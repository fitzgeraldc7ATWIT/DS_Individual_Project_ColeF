## Introduction

The objective of this project is to use measurements to predict the output of a solar power system installed in Berkely, CA. I was always curious about how different conditions can affect the output of solar powered systems.

I was inspired to do this project simply because I find solar power and energy to be quite interesting. I would really like to in the future see a more efficient solar system be created because of the potential I feel that solar power has.

## Data Selection

The data has over 2,900 samples with 16 columns: 
'Day of Year','Year', 'Month', 'Day', 'First Hour of Period','Is Daylight', 'Distance to Solar Noon', 'Average Temperature (Day)','Average Wind Direction (Day)', 'Average Wind Speed (Day)', 'Sky Cover',   'Visibility', 'Relative Humidity', 'Average Wind Speed (Period)','Average Barometric Pressure (Period)', 'Power Generated'.

The purpose being a model created to predict the output of a solar power system. The dataset can be found online at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipulgote4/solar-power-generation/)
